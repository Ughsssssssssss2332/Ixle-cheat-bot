### ⚠ WARNING ⚠
This is a very unprofessional GitHub repository. If you have any complaints, I'm too lazy so I probably won't do anything about it.

# IXL-BOT
This is a program that does IXL automatically. It takes a screenshot, scans the screenshot for text, solves the problem, and types it it. This is nowhere near finished. There is probably a way more efficient way of doing this but I don't care.

## IMPORTANT:
USING THIS IS CONSIDERED CHEATING! IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE FOR USING THIS IT'S NOT MY FAULT. Please do not use this unless you have extreme anxiety and depression from IXL.

## (Also me sad. This doesn't work on Chromebook.)
The  ```pyautogui.screenshot()``` function only returns a black screen.

## INFO
 This can run on Windows and Linux. (Sadly, it can't run on ChromeOS, but there might be a way to get it to run on a Chromebook using crouton [https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton]. I'll test this later.)

 It uses the following Python libraries:
- pyaugoui
- pytesseract
- cv2 (opencv-python)
- tkinter

You can reuse any of this code (This has a GNU General Public License).

I'm going to put a password on this so I know who's using it, but if you know Python, it'll be pretty easy to get rid of the password.

## THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED
This project is a work in progress. It is not currently usable. It will be added to "Releases" once a usable version comes out.
