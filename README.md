### ⚠ WARNING ⚠
This is a very unprofessional GitHub repository. If you have any complaints, I'm too lazy so I probably won't do anything about it.

# IXL-BOT
This is a program that does IXL automatically. It takes a screenshot, scans the screenshot for text, solves the problem, and types it it. This is nowhere near finished. There is probably a way more efficient way of doing this but I don't care.

## IMPORTANT:
USING THIS IS CONSIDERED CHEATING! Please do not use this unless you have extreme anxiety and depression from IXL.

## (Also me sad. This doesn't work on Chromebook.)
The pyautogui.screenshot() function only returns a black screen.

## INFO
 This can run on Windows and Linux. (Sadly, it can't run on ChromeOS, but there is a way to get it to run on a Chromebook using crouton [https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton].)

 It uses the following Python libraries:
- pyaugoui
- pytesseract
- cv2 (opencv-python)
- tkinter

## THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED
This project is a work in progress. It is not currently usable. It will be added to "Releases" once a usable version comes out.
