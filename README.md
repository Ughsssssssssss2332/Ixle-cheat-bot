### ⚠ WARNING ⚠
This is a very unprofessional GitHub repository. If you have any complaints, I'm too lazy so I probably won't do anything about it.

# IXL-BOT
This is a program that does IXL automatically. It takes a screenshot, scans the screenshot for text, solves the problem, and types it it. This is nowhere near finished. There is probably a way more efficient way of doing this but I don't care.

### IMPORTANT:
USING THIS IS CONSIDERED CHEATING! IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE FOR USING THIS IT'S NOT MY FAULT. Please do not use this unless you have extreme anxiety and depression from IXL.

## If you don't know what any of this means
All you need to know is it is not finished and will be easier to use when it's finished.

## Stuff I need to do right now:
 - COME UP WITH A BETTER NAME THAN "IXL-Bot"
 - Create better logo
 - Finish writing 'main_menu.py'
 - Find out how to use tkinter styles

## RELEASE INFORMATION
(The current version of this program is unusable. When a usable version comes out, it will be added to "Releases".)

### Standard version
This will have support for lessons saved in the files. This is recommended if you want to get questions correct.

### AI version
This version will use machine learning to solve problems. It will have to get questions wrong in order to get other questions right. This might take awhile to make. This version will only have support for basic problems.

### Versions
 - (Unfinished) VERSION 0.1 Standard [beta]: This will have to be ran from the command line and it will not be an app that gets installed on your system. It will only have support for a few basic IXL lessons. This will probably not be very useful.

 - (Unfinished) VERSION 0.1 AI [beta]: This will add an AI mode that uses machine learning to solve problems. You probably shouldn't use this version if you want to get all the questions right. It will have to get questions wrong to work properly.

## THIS CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK ON CHROMEBOOK
I am writing most of this code from my Chromebook at school. I'm pretty sure most schools use Chromebook, so I'm trying to get it to work on that.

Below is a list of functions that don't work on Chromebook.
I still need to test if the screenshot function would work in a chroot.

LIST OF STUFF THAT DOESN'T WORK (This will be updated):
- ```pyautogui.screenshot()``` - It works, but it just returns a black screen.
- ```keyboard.write('')``` won't let me do anything.

## If Someone From IXL Sees This
Please don't sue me.

## INFO
 This can run on Windows and Linux. (Sadly, it can't run on ChromeOS, but there might be a way to get it to run on a Chromebook using crouton [https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton]. I'll test this later.)

 It uses the following Python libraries:
- pyautogui
- pytesseract
- cv2 (opencv-python)
- tkinter

You can reuse any of this code (This has a GNU General Public License).

I'm going to put a password on this so I know who's using it, but if you know Python, it'll be pretty easy to get rid of the password.

## THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED
This project is a work in progress. It is not currently usable. It will be added to "Releases" once a usable version comes out.
