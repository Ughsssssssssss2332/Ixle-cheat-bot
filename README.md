### ⚠ WARNING ⚠
This is a very unprofessional GitHub repository. If you have any complaints, I'm too lazy so I probably won't do anything about it.

# IXL-BOT
This is a program that does IXL automatically. It takes a screenshot, scans the screenshot for text, solves the problem, and types it it. This is nowhere near finished. There is probably a way more efficient way of doing this but I don't care.

## IMPORTANT:
USING THIS IS CONSIDERED CHEATING! Please do not use this unless you have extreme anxiety and depression from IXL.

## (Also me sad. This doesn't work on Chromebook.)
The pyautogui.screenshot() function only returns a black screen.
